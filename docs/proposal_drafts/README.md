# Quick start

```bash
make new-draft NEW_FEATURE_NAME
```
Gives you a new proposal base document.

# What is this about?

As a developer, sometimes, a bigger and more structured discussion is required for some features.

Why not use issues and tickets:

- Github issues do not work that well as it's hard to keep the proposal drafts updated while the discussion is going on.
- Pull requests allows people to contribute to the discussion and agree/disagree in the same way the do with code.
- Generates an initial draft upon which it will be acted upon.
- Allows us to retain part of the inherit knowledge related to the problem in written form and not stuck with the person implementing it.
- Problem description stays with the code.
